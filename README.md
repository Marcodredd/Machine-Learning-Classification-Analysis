# Machine-Learning-Classification-Analysis
## Classification Algorithms using the Titanic dataset
After taken the course Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024] on Udemy by Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and others, this repository is to document the knowledge gained by predicting the if someone who was on board the titanic survived or not.
The data was downloaded from Kaggle, already segmented into train and test sets.

The following machine learning classification algorithms will be tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Kernel SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## The Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score
The Confusion Matrix will be used to ascertain the following:
- True Positives
- True Negatives
- False Positives
- False Negatives

And the accuracy score of each classifier using the accuracy_score method
Logistic Regression - 82%
Naive Bayes  - 79%
KNN - 79%
SVC - 78%
Kernel SVM - 81%
DT Classifier - 77%
RF Classifier - 79%
